# Minishell

A minimalistic shell implementation in C, replicating features of basic Unix shells. This project provides a simple shell environment with support for built-in commands, basic command execution, and command-line parsing.

## Features

- **Command Execution**: Executes both built-in and external commands.
- **Built-in Commands**:
  - `echo`: Prints text to the terminal with `-n` option handling.
  - `pwd`: Prints the current working directory.
  - `exit`: Exits the shell.
- **Command-Line Parsing**: Handles command-line input and tokenizes commands and arguments.
- **Option Handling**: Supports options like `-n` for the `echo` command.
