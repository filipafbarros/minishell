# 🐚✨ MiniShell - A Tiny Shell with Big Ambitions ✨🐚

Welcome to our MiniShell project! This is a 42 school project that involves reimplementing a "mini" bash terminal.
A program capable of parsing a prompt and launching executables with arguments, along with a few built-in functions.

## 🌟 Features 🌟

- ✨ **Interactive Prompt**: Display a prompt while waiting for a new command.
- 📜 **Command History**: Keep track of command history using readline.
- 🚀 **Command Execution**: Execute binaries found in the PATH, relative, or absolute paths.
- 🛡️ **Signal Handling**: Graceful handling of ctrl-C, ctrl-D, and ctrl-\ like in bash.
- 💬 **Quoting**: Handle single (') and double (") quotes to prevent shell interpretation of meta-characters.
- 🔄 **Redirections**: Implement input (<), output (>), append (>>), and here-document (<<) redirections.
- 🔗 **Pipes**: Support for pipes (|) to pass output of one command as input to another.
- 🌐 **Environment Variables**: Expand environment variables and handle special $? variable.
- 🔧 **Built-in Commands**: Includes echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env, and exit.

## 🚀 Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites 📋
