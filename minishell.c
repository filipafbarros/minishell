Structure t_msh:

If t_msh contains fields that are arrays or pointers, and their sizes are not known 
at compile time or they need to grow/shrink dynamically, you should allocate memory 
dynamically for those fields.
If t_msh only contains simple data types (like integers or fixed-size arrays) and 
pointers to memory that is already managed elsewhere (like env), then you don't 
necessarily need to allocate memory dynamically for the t_msh structure itself.
Sub-Structures or Arrays in t_msh:

If t_msh contains sub-structures or arrays that need dynamic memory, you should 
allocate memory for them. For example, if t_msh has a field char **env that you
 need to copy from the env parameter, then you need to allocate memory for 
 the array and each string.
